## Better Bullets (Congruent Tone)

### Shodo:
- "The breathing pattern Master Kaoru uses to enter flow state—sync your hand with your breath (Page 18)"
- "Why 'mistakes' in shodo have more character than perfect strokes (this changed how I see imperfection)"
- "The single kanji that teaches you everything about balance, pressure, and flow (most students master it in one sitting)"
- "How to turn 10 minutes of practice into moving meditation (it's not about the duration, it's about this)"
- "The ink-to-water ratio that gives you that perfect flowing black (too much water = gray, too little = scratchy)"

### Shodo Option B - Practical Phrases

### Shodo Option C - Emotional Expression
"**Bonus: The Shodo Mood Library**
12 characters that express specific emotions (joy, calm, strength, gratitude). When you feel something, you'll know which character to write."

### Shodo Option D - Display Guide

## Add More Emotional/Sensory Language

### Examples:
- "The wet whisper of brush on paper"
- "The weight of the brush in your hand, perfectly balanced"
- "Black ink blooming into rice paper"
- "The silence between strokes"

## Remove Any "Yes-Yes" Sentences

Audit for:
- "We care about you"
- "Best X in the world"
- Any generic, unprovable claims

Replace with specific, provable statements.
