## Style Notes for All Images

**Consistent aesthetic across all images:**
- Warm cream/beige backgrounds (#FAF8F5, #F5F1E8)
- Natural soft lighting (never harsh studio flash)
- Minimal, clean compositions
- Warm gold tones that glow
- Japanese wabi-sabi aesthetic
- Think: Kinfolk magazine, Cereal magazine, Aesop brand photography
- Avoid: Busy backgrounds, bright colors, overly saturated images, stock photo feel

**Color palette to maintain:**
- Cream/off-white backgrounds
- Warm wood tones
- Antique gold (not bright yellow gold)
- Soft shadows (gray, not black)
- Natural ceramic colors (white, cream, beige)
