# Meta Ads Copy - Japanese Calligraphy School

## Primary Ad (Main Campaign)

**Primary Text:**

When was the last time you _created_ something?

Not a Reel. Not consumed. Not scrolled. Not bought something made by machines in factories.

When was the last time you made art with your hands that made someone say "Wait... YOU made this?"

When was the last time you felt completely present—not thinking about work, not checking your phone, just... creating?

No expensive pair of skis or collection of products can fill the void you have. You need to create.

You want a hobby that's actually meaningful. Something meditative. Something therapeutic.

Not another thing to consume. Something to CREATE.

Shodo (書道) is the 500-year-old Japanese art of meditative calligraphy with brush and ink.

It's peaceful. Meditative. Screen-free.

The philosophy behind it:
→ Ma: beauty in negative space
→ Mushin: the no-mind flow state
→ Ichigo ichie: this stroke will never exist again

Master Kaoru Tanaka has practiced this in Kamakura for 40 years. She's teaching it online for the first time.

You'll create art with ink and brush. Frame pieces for your walls. Make gifts that carry meaning. Express what you can't put into words.

Your terrible handwriting doesn't matter. That's your style. That's your personality on paper.

For the first 50 online students the price will be $47.

## Image Recommendations

**Primary creative options:**
1. Bold black ink stroke on white washi paper (dramatic, eye-catching)
2. Hand holding brush mid-stroke (shows process, human element)
3. Finished shodo piece framed on minimalist wall (aspirational outcome)
4. Split image: Phone scrolling vs brush creating (problem/solution)

**Best bet:** Bold ink stroke - simple, striking, scrolls well

Your screen time is up again.

Another hour scrolling. Another day consuming instead of creating.

You want a hobby that's actually meaningful. Not another app. Not another subscription.

Something meditative. Something real.

Shodo is the Japanese art of brush calligraphy. 500 years old. Deeply therapeutic. Completely screen-free.

Master Kaoru Tanaka (40 years in Kamakura) is teaching it online for the first time.

10 minutes of focused practice beats an hour of distracted scrolling.

First 50 students: $47.

**Headline:**
Stop Consuming. Start Creating.

**Description:**

### Variation 3: Curiosity Hook

**Primary Text:**

Why would a 40-year master teach an ancient art to complete beginners online?

Because she watched a generation drown in screens.

"They need this more than anyone," Master Kaoru realized.

Shodo (書道) isn't about perfect letters. It's about presence. Expression. Creating something that could only exist because you made it.

One breath. One stroke. No going back.

Your handwriting doesn't matter. Your "messy" strokes ARE your style.

This is meditation that actually works. Therapy without talking. Art without needing talent.

First 50 students: $47.

**Headline:**
