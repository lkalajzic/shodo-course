### 6. Images Needed

**Before launch, you need these images:**

The landing page expects these files in `/landing/public/`:

1. **`shodohero.jpg`** - Hero section
   - Bold black ink stroke on white washi paper
   - Or: Brush creating a dramatic stroke
   - Size: 1200x900px recommended

2. **`shodo-vs-screen.jpg`** - Problem section
   - Split image: hand creating calligraphy vs scrolling phone
   - Or: Traditional calligraphy setup (brush, ink, paper)
   - Size: 800x800px

3. **`master-kaoru.jpg`** - Story section
   - Elegant Japanese woman (60s) at calligraphy desk
   - Traditional studio setting, serene and focused
   - Size: 1200x1600px (portrait)

4. **`shodo-finished.jpg`** - Above pricing
   - Finished shodo work - bold kanji on washi paper
   - Multiple pieces or single dramatic piece
   - Size: 1200x800px

**Where to get images:**
- **AI generate:** Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion
- **Stock photos:** Unsplash, Pexels (search "japanese calligraphy" "shodo" "sumi ink")
- **Important:** Make sure they match the minimalist aesthetic (cream/grey/black/red color scheme)

**Prompts for AI image generation:**
1. Hero: "Japanese calligraphy brush creating bold black ink stroke on white washi paper, minimalist, dramatic, close-up, professional photography"
2. Master Kaoru: "Elegant Japanese woman in her 60s practicing shodo calligraphy at traditional desk in Kamakura studio, serene, focused, natural lighting, photorealistic, peaceful atmosphere"
3. Finished work: "Bold Japanese kanji character in black ink on cream washi paper, minimalist composition, museum quality, overhead shot"

### 7. Launch Meta Ads

**See `meta_ads_copy.md` for full details**

**Quick start:**
1. Use Main Primary Text (the one you edited together)
2. Headline: "When Was The Last Time You Created Something Real?"
3. Description: "Learn shodo from a 40-year Kamakura master. Meditative calligraphy with brush and ink."
4. Image: Bold ink stroke (most eye-catching)
5. Budget: $20-30/day for 3-5 days
6. Targeting: See meta_ads_copy.md

---

## 📋 PRE-LAUNCH TESTING

Before running ads, test the full funnel:

1. **Local testing:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/luka/Documents/coding/shodo-course/landing
   bun install  # if packages need installing
   bun run dev
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:3001
   - Check all sections render correctly
   - Click CTA buttons (they'll alert about missing Stripe link - that's OK for now)

2. **After Vercel deployment:**
   - Visit japanesecalligraphy.school
   - Test full flow: Landing → Click CTA → Stripe checkout → Thank you page
   - Verify GTM & FB Pixel firing (use Facebook Pixel Helper Chrome extension)
   - Test on mobile (iPhone and Android if possible)

3. **Before ads:**
   - Send link to 2-3 friends for feedback
   - Check load speed (should be fast with Next.js)
   - Proofread all copy one more time

---

## 💰 VALIDATION GOALS

**Success metrics:**
- 5-10 purchases at $47 = Validated demand
- If you hit this, the niche works
- Then decide: Build the course OR refund buyers

**What to watch:**
- Facebook Ads Manager: CTR, CPC, conversions
- Stripe Dashboard: Actual purchases
- If 0 sales after $100 spent → kill it, try next niche

Good luck! 🖌️

The positioning is solid, copy is strong, page is beautiful. If this doesn't convert, it's the niche, not the execution.
